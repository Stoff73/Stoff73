# Welcome to my Github

I am busy learning to code after working in financial services for the last 30 years.

At the tender age of 50, starting a new career is exciting, I look forward to bringing my 
wealth of experience and knowledge to the field.

I am currently doing a Cyber Security bootcamp, funded by UK Department of Education, which 
is an area that has been in the press a lot recently.

I have always had an interest in computers, from when I was a kid and we had to dial into the 
interent using a US Robotics modem,with no one else being able to use the phone. Installing games,
meant you had to have a very good understanding of DOS, the prompt, drivers, memory allocation, 
to name a small portion of technical knowledge you had to have as a 10 year old computer gamer in the 80's.

I did a cobol programming course in the 90's while I was a stock broker, I also completed an MCSE
with TCP/IP during this time. My exposure to the technical side of IT has been limited over the last 20 
years, so getting back into it has been eye opening.

Currently learning Python, a lot easier than Cobol and much more powerfull. 

As I am learning and need to get as much experience as possible, if anyone needs anything done, 
I would be happy to have a chat and see if I can help with your coding needs.
