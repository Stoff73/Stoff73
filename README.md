# Welcome to my Github

I am busy learnign to code after working financial services for the last 30 years.

At the tender age of 50, starting a new career is exciting, I look forward ot bringing my 
wealth of experience and knowledge to the field.

I am currently doing a Cyber Security bootcamp, funded by UK Department of Education, which 
is an area that has garnedered a large amount of attention recently.

I have always had an interest in computers, from when I was a kid and we had to dial into the interent using a US Robotics modem,
wiht no one else being able to use the phone. Installing games, meant you had to have a very good unserstanding of DOS, the prompt,
drivers, memeroy allocation to name a few, just to get them to play.

I did a cobol programming course in the 90's while I was a stock broker, I also completed an MCSE with TCP/IP in the 90's. 
My exposure to the technical side of IT has been limited over the last 20 years, so getting back into it has been eye 
opening.

Currently learning Python, a lot easier than Cobol and much more powerfull. 

As I am learning and need to get as much experience as possible, if anyone needs anything done, I would be happy to 
have a chat and see if I can help with your coding needs. 

Best way to get hold of me is my email: c.jones@csjones.co
